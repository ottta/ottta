Many of type designer/foundry website do parse opentype data in <em>manual mode</em>, it easy if they were only have a couple font style in a family, but it's more complicated to handling large ammount of data. So I decided to make a <em>software as a service</em> to solve many problem specific to font publishing. A built-in program automatically parse opentype data much more accurate then manually input what they font can do. It is robust, powerful, and future proof."
